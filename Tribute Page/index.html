   <strong>Catherine of Siena</strong> (25 March 1347 - 29 April 1380), a lay member of the <a href= "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order">Dominican Order</a>, was a mystic, activist, and author who had a great influence on Italian literature and the Catholic Church. Canonized in 1461, she is also a <a href= "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Of_The_Church">Doctor of the church.</a>
</p>

  She was born and raised in <a href= "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena">Siena</a>, and at an early age wanted to devote herself to God, against the will of her parents. She joined the Dominican tertiaries. She made herself known very quickly by being marked by mystical phenomena such as invisible stigmata and a <a href= "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystical_Marriage">mystical marriage</a>. As a child Catherine was so merry that the family gave her the pet name of <strong>Euphrosyne</strong>, which is Greek for <strong>Joy</strong> and the name of an <strong>Euphrosyne of Alexandria</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Catherine is said by her confessor and biographer <strong>Raymond of Capua O.P.'s Life</strong> to have had her first vision of Christ when she was five or six years old: she and a brother were on the way home from visiting a married sister when she is said to have experienced a vision of Christ seated in glory with the Apostles Peter, Paul, and John. Raymond continues that at age seven, Catherine vowed to give her whole life to God.
</p>

<p>
When Catherine was sixteen, her older sister Bonaventura died in childbirth; already anguished by this, Catherine soon learned that her parents wanted her to marry Bonaventura's widower. She was absolutely opposed and started a strict fast. She had learned this from Bonaventura, whose husband had been far from considerate but his wife had changed his attitude by refusing to eat until he showed better manners. Besides fasting, Catherine further disappointed her mother by <strong>cutting off her long hair</strong> as a protest against being overly encouraged to improve her appearance to attract a husband.

<p>
  In late November 1378, with the outbreak of the <strong>Western Schism</strong>, the new Pope, Urban VI, summoned her to Rome. She stayed at Pope Urban VI's court and tried to convince nobles and cardinals of his legitimacy, both meeting with individuals at court and writing letters to persuade others. 
For many years she had accustomed herself to a rigorous abstinence. She received the Holy Eucharist almost daily. This extreme fasting appeared unhealthy in the eyes of the clergy and her own sisterhood. Her confessor, Raymond, ordered her to eat properly. But Catherine claimed that she was unable to, describing her inability to eat as an infermit√† (illness). From the beginning of 1380, Catherine could neither eat nor swallow water. On February 26 she lost the use of her legs.
</p>

<p>
  She died on 29 April 1380, exhausted by her penances. Urban VI celebrated her funeral and burial in the <a href= "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_Of_Santa_Maria_Sopra_Minevera_In_Rome">Basilica of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome.</a>
